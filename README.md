# BibleWebScraper

This is a webscraper developed by Nicholas Yao [@PShuckle] and John Chen [@johnchen383] using Python. It scrapes the bible.com (https://www.bible.com/bible/59/MAT.1.ESV) site, and outputs a selection of scripture in a given translation without the subheaders and verse numbers, in pdf form. This is not intended for commercial use of any means and solely was required to put into practice developer skills whilst facilitating Quiet Time and personal bible studies.
